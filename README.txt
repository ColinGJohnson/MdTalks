The three main areas of the website are:

Admins: only administrators of the website have access to these pages. The area allows user to do everything
except delete users (but they can ban users).

Groups: everyone has access to this area. Users can create groups, become moderators in their groups, 
and join other people's groups. They can also make announcements and discuss subjects in these groups.

Accounts: this area has limited access for your average user. 
Normal users can view other people's profiles (unless it's private), edit their own profiles,
Verify their account, make accounts and login/logout.
