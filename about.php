		Welcome to <b>Mount Doug Talks!</b> You may be wondering what the purpose of this website is!<br />
		Mount Doug Talks is a forum-type website for our school: Mount Douglas Secondary. Here (after registering), you can create groups, have discussions, and post announcements!
		<br /><br />
		Groups are the main feature of this website. In a group, you can announce things to the entire group or have discussions with other members.
		If you're a moderator of the group, you can change the logo, the group description, and add new moderators!
		<br /><br />
		To join a group, go to your profile page and press the "Join Group" button. This should take you to a list of groups
		you aren't in yet. Click on one, and the group moderators will approve (or regretfully decline) your request.
		<br /><br />
		To create a group, go to your profile page (located on the top right and symbolized by your first name) and scroll down to the "Create Group" text box.
		Enter your group's name, and you'll now have your very own group!
		<br /><br />
		We hope you enjoy the website! If you have any questions, email us at <b>mountdougtalks@gmail.com</b> or simply click the <b>Contact Us</b> link at the bottom of the page.
